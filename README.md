Here is some information about my exercise:

If you start the game you spawn on the map with 4 characters. Every character start with a simple handgun and 10 bullets. 
You can walk through the level and shoot on enemy’s. If you shoot on the enemy while in group, everyone shoots. 
If you shoot when you are walking solo only the selected character shoots. You can pick up items and ammo with the selected character. 
There are three sorts of ammo, you can only pickup ammo if you have the correspondent weapon of it. A character can’t pick up 2 of the same weapons. 
You need to switch characters if you want to have another character with the same weapon (there are 3 types of 
weapons in the game so every character can have 3 weapons and switch between them). If your inventory is full you can’t pick up any items except ammo. 
The enemies fire back if you attack them! They always attack the selected character first. You can die so be careful. 
If you die you switch to another character. The not selected characters follow the selected character (ass you asked). 
They regroup to a square formation when you are at your destination. 

A list of features 

          •	You can walk through level if you click on the ground (left mouse button).

          •	Changing character with the right mouse button. Just click on 1 of the 4 characters.

          •	Killing enemy’s (be careful, they fire back) with clicking on the enemy (blue capsules)
          with your left mouse button. They will disappear when they die.

          •	Picking up weapons (just walk over them).

          •	Switching between weapons with mouse scroll wheel (only if you have more than 1 weapon).

          •	Picking up Ammo. Each weapon has its own ammo, you can only pick up the ammo if you have 
          the corresponding weapon.

          •	Picking up Health boxes (only show in inventory).

          •	Opening inventory (pressing I) and see your weapons and Health box in there. If inventory 
          is full you can’t pick up items anymore (12 spaces) 

          •	Enemy’s shoot at you if you attack them.

          •	Walking in group (they follow the selected character and when you are at your destination 
          the regroup to a square pattern).

          •	Walking solo or regroup (press the G button to walk solo or regroup).

          •	Camera switch between selected characters and follow them but the camera doesn’t change 
          its angle (like in the real Syndicate game).

          •	HUD that updates info:

                    o	Selected player (Player icon turns yellow)

                    o	Active weapon (weapon icon changes when you switch weapon)

                    o	Bullets (Bullets are visible on the HUD)
